TODO: Stop-and-Wait RDT(Reliable Data Transfer) Protocol

1. RDT based to Stop-and_Wait
    1000 Byte size Packet
    Sender -> Receiver : Data packet, exit(EOT) packet
    Receiver -> Sender : ACK packet

2. packet struction definition
    packet class definition (struct or class)
    header field
        type : DATA || ACK || EOT
        seqNum : transfering packet number (start 0)
        ackNum : checking seqNum
        length : Data length (length of ACK and EOT is 0)
    
3. Stop-and-Wait Core logic
    1. After Sender sends 1 packet, sender waits ACK packet.
    2. when Time is outed, this packet should retransmitted.
    3. when Receiver is receive duplicated packet, this packet is ignored & Receiver sends ACK

4. Packet loss emulation
    Sender : ACK packet drop percent : when sender receive ack packet
    Receiver : Data packet drop percent : when receiver receive data packet
        -> 0.0 ~ 1.0 discard
    
5. Timer (Timeout)
    Use alarm(timeoutInterval) system call
    signal handler : when time is out, retransmmmition packet.
